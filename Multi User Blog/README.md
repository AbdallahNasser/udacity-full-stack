# Multi User Blog
------
 The Multi-User Blog is a project I built (along the lines of Medium) where users can sign in and post blog posts as well as 'Like' and 'Comment' on other posts made on the blog. The app is hosted on Google App Engine. All users were granted privileged access via an authentication system. The live site can be visited here: [`barely-speaking.appspot.com`](barely-speaking.appspot.com)
