### Problem statement

In this project you will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see your favorite movies and watch the trailers.
You'll be writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs.
The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.
