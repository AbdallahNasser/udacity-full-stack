# Movie Trailer Website: Fresh Tomatoes

This is the first project for the fulfillment of Udacity's [Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

### About

This project provides a simple server-side script to generate a website of movie trailers from a CSV data file.

### How to run

To run the script, clone this repository directory and run `fresh_tomatoes.py`.  It should automatically open your
default browser and open the new page generated. You can also view the page by opening `fresh_tomatoes.html` created
manually.

### Note

As this is an evolving project I am going to tag various complete versions of them and add a sample of that version
in ditribute folder.
